## 10/8/2025 - Finished the PCB Schematic and Assigned Footprints  

I made the matrix for the keys and assigned them to pins on the controller. When I was making the matrix I had accidentally added an extra row so it had one more row than there were pins, I was trying to find out why for a while and eventually I went through every key and found the extra row and removed it. Otherwise it was mostly what is in the guide but with extra keys and a power switch

## 10/17/2025 - Finished the Layout and Routed the PCB  

The layout and routing of the PCB is done! I spent a while trying to make a layout I liked, making the Edge.Cuts layer for it, and then mirroring it all. After that it was pretty simple to route everything together and add silkscreen for the battery pads, power switch, and the name of the keyboard
