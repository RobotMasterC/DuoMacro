## 10/8/2025 - Finished the PCB Schematic and Assigned Footprints  

I made the matrix for the keys and assigned them to pins on the controller. When I was making the matrix I had accidentally added an extra row so it had one more row than there were pins, I was trying to find out why for a while and eventually I went through every key and found the extra row and removed it. Otherwise it was mostly what is in the guide but with extra keys and a power switch
